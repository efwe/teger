# Routing MQTT messages with spring-boot
This repository contains my spring-boot test application which is essentially a combination of two tutorials:
* [Spring Integration MQTT](http://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/reference/html/mqtt.html)
* [Spring Boot Websockets](https://spring.io/guides/gs/messaging-stomp-websocket/)
You can find a live version of this at [123k.de](http://123k.de)

#Messaging Configuration
We have a `@Configuration` in `MessageConfig`. There we use the MQTT receiver from the tutorial.
The MQTT receiver is a `ChannelAdapter` from a spring-integration point of view. This initially feeds the MQTT messages
to the messaging-system (a `DirectChannel` called `mqttInputChannel`). 
Then we have a `@Router` which listens on `mqttInputChannel` and 
routes messages based on payload either to `officeStream` or `OutsideStream`. Additionally
*all* messages are published on the `temperatureStream`. All of those channels are `PublishSubscribeChannel` so that
we can install more listeners later.

#Websocket Configuration
On the other hand we have the websocket-configuration in `WebsocketConfig`.
This is all just a copy of the websocket tutorial. We initialise a simple broker which holds topics at `/topic` and provides a stomp-endpoint on `temperature`.

On client side we create a `SocksJS` socket and boot a `StompClient`.
There we register to two topics 

```coffeescript
    socket = new SockJS('/temperature')
    @stompClient = Stomp.over(socket)
    @obelometer = new Obelometer()
    connect = () =>
      showOfficeTemperature = (message) =>
        @obelometer.showTemperature(JSON.parse(message.body))

      showOutsideTemperature = (message) =>
        @showOutsideTemperature(JSON.parse(message.body))

      @stompClient.subscribe '/topic/officeStream', showOfficeTemperature
      @stompClient.subscribe '/topic/outsideStream', showOutsideTemperature
    @stompClient.connect({}, connect)
```

#Glue Code
So now we have the spring-boot integration messaging infrastructure
and the websocket simple broker. What we have to do 
is to route the messages to the broker handling websockets.

The following lines are the glue code.

```Java
   private final SimpMessagingTemplate template;

   @ServiceActivator(inputChannel = "officeStream")
    public void officeMessage(Message<TemperatureMessage> message) throws Exception {
        this.template.convertAndSend("/topic/officeStream", message.getPayload());
    }
```

This listens on the input-channel where we routed our MQTT messages to and sends those messages to the websocket-topic via the messaging-template utilizing the simple-broker which handles all the websocket-integration.

#Event Source
If you really want to try this application and you want to have a simple event-source you can checkout the [__cimon__](https://bitbucket.org/efwe/cimon) application.

#Open Ends
This na√Øve approach just worked. With the abstraction of spring-integration one can easily route any incoming message to websocket
listeners. What currently is missing:
* Push the last seen temperatures `onConnect` to the new WebSocket client
* Store and aggregate the temperatures to provide a history view
